### Start Learning

I have created a roadmap for beginners.

My aim here is bug bounty, no one knows where to start

Every bug hunter has their own methods. I will start to show you a method that will carry bug bounty

step by step here.

1. First lesson.
2. Forget what you know

3. Make learning practical, read a lot

4. I strongly recommend HTTP: The Definitive Guide or Network+.

There is very valuable information in HTTP: The Definitive Guide, there are topics such as web poisoning and HTTP request smuggling
Knowing the http structure will take you one step ahead, so read and research the pdf and yourself

HTTP Methods

GET
POST
PUT
HEAD
DELETE
PATCH
OPTIONS
CONNECT
TRACE

HTTP Status Messages
1xx
2xx
3xx
4xx
5xx

You will have mastery over topics like this and a bug bounty hunter should know network very well.

No matter what field you work in, you should know how to go to Google, the underlying thing is networking.
