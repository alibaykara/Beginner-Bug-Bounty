## How to Write a Bug Bounty Report

When you identify a vulnerability during a bug bounty program, it's crucial to provide a detailed, clear, and reproducible report. This will not only help the security team reproduce and fix the issue faster, but it will also make sure you are rewarded for your efforts.

A well-structured report typically contains the following sections:

1. **Title**
2. **Description**
3. **Steps to Reproduce**
4. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**
5. **Expected Behavior**
6. **Actual Behavior**
7. **Impact Assessment**
8. **Remediation Suggestions**
9. **References**

## Bug Report Structure

Here’s a template for structuring your bug report:

### 1. Title
- Provide a clear and concise title summarizing the vulnerability.

### 2. Description
- Describe the vulnerability, including its type (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection), affected area (e.g., specific URL, page), and the impact.

### 3. Steps to Reproduce
- Provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue. This should be as detailed as possible to allow the security team to easily follow along.

### 4. Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Attach any relevant screenshots, videos, or code that demonstrates the vulnerability in action.

### 5. Expected Behavior
- Describe what should happen in a secure version of the application.

### 6. Actual Behavior
- Describe what is happening currently (i.e., the security vulnerability in action).

### 7. Impact Assessment
- Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability, such as data leakage, account takeover, or unauthorized access.

### 8. Remediation Suggestions
- Provide any suggestions you may have for fixing the vulnerability. This is optional but helpful for the security team.

### 9. References
- Include any relevant links or references, such as OWASP guidelines, other CVE entries, or useful documentation.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Identify the vulnerability**: Perform security testing using tools or manual inspection.
2. **Verify the vulnerability**: Ensure that the issue can be reliably reproduced.
3. **Document your findings**: Write the bug bounty report following the structure above.
4. **Submit your report**: Follow the program’s guidelines to submit your findings.

## Example Report

Here’s an example of a typical bug bounty report:

### Title: Stored XSS on User Profile Page

### Description:
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in the bio section of the user profile page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed when the page is loaded by other users.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to `https://example.com/user/profile`.
2. In the "Bio" field, inject the following payload: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
3. Save the profile.
4. Reload the page, and the JavaScript will execute.

### Proof of Concept (PoC):
[Include a screenshot/video showing the injected payload]

### Expected Behavior:
The application should sanitize user inputs in the bio field to prevent script execution.

### Actual Behavior:
The injected JavaScript executes on the page, leading to potential session hijacking.

### Impact Assessment:
This vulnerability allows attackers to steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.

### Remediation Suggestions:
Sanitize user input on the server-side using OWASP-recommended methods to prevent XSS.

## Remediation Tips

- Always sanitize user inputs to prevent code injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection).
- Regularly update your security tools and perform penetration testing.
- Follow security best practices outlined by organizations like OWASP.
